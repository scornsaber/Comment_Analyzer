That to me means twins  and tripples got a handy cap so it was competitive...hell v4s got a handicap....alowing them more then 1000cc\nTake each config of a motor limit them to the same displacement and then pound for pound lets see whats actually competitive. 2,3, inline 4 or v4. Could be wrong but its prolly gonna be the inline 4.",

I personally don't like it because I don't care how it performs on professional racing, the bike is ugly and sounds terrible compared to any other inline 4 120ish bike. 98% of people are not pro racers including me so they're not buying bikes for how good they are at the limit in a track, they are buying it for its sound, looks and street performance, this bike fails in 2 areas already compared to an R6 or even a 2025 zx6r. If you can't love how your bike looks then that's a bad bike and turn around every time you leave it and say damn, then it's a bad bike in my book. The last gen R6 was easily top 5 best looking sportbikes ever made, so sleek and pretty and now we have this wannabe transformer with a hole in the middle and ugly lights. Say whatever you want about how it performs in pro racing, if you buy it because of that then I'd dare say you like hype, not motorcycles.",
